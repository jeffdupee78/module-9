                founded by 20 kingdoms 800 years ago and has grown influence.
               <br/> Although the World Government is considered an organization that upholds justice by protecting 
                civilians and seeks a peaceful world,<br/> but in reality, they are corrupt and oppressive 
                organization, particularly through the application of absolute justice, their suppression <br/>of academia and research of 
                history such as the Void Century and Lineage Factor's, the depravity of the aristocratic World Nobles<br/> coupled with distaff
                 ruling hierarchy and the falsification of the Empty Throne.</p>
